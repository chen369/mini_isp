<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>FreeNet Software
requirements and Installation Instructions </B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">FreeNet
is very easy to install since most of the work of installation is
done by FreeNet over a remote connection to your server. FreeNet runs
under Ubuntu Linux a completely free open source operating system.
The software license for FreeNet is inclusive of all the other
software needed to run on your FreeNet server including the operating
system. No other software licenses to Microsoft or anyone else is
needed. FreeNet is a completely turnkey operation with little or no
effort.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Minimum hardware
requirements to install and start a FreeNet minimal system.</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">1.
Recommend a server PC computer with at least a 1.7 Ghz single core
processor with 512 meg memory and at least a 20 gig available hard
disk space. We have run on as small as 6 gig hard disk systems with
900 meg processors with only 64meg of memory but I'm not sure we
still can support that with the present software we now run and we
did run into problems with 64 meg memory that required reboots at
times to correct (maybe once a month). You might want to provide a
300 gig hard disk or more to utilize the video on demand, music MP3
and other file sharing and PXE boot off LAN features that FreeNet has
to offer. If you already have an old computer system laying around
not being used it can't hurt to try it. If you can install Ubuntu
8.04 on it and it runs it will probably work for a FreeNet server.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">2. A
single ADSL Internet connection with minimum 100kB/sec Internet
bandwidth from almost any ISP provider. We will recommend an ISP for
you to use for the aria you are in and instruct you on how to get it
if you don't already have one.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">3. A
single wifi accespoint to connect your network to the world. I guess
this could be an option if you ran a wire only network but wifi is
also a good way to self advertise and brings in new customers.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Optional added hardware
and tools</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">4. We
highly recommend a UPS (uninterpretable power supply) to prevent
short power spikes from disrupting your service and damaging
equipment. With installations of 10 or more customers this is
mandatory to meet FreeNet minimal specifications. In most cases when
a site grows to 10 or more customers in size we send a local FreeNet
representative to visit the site to audit and check your installation
for minimal requirements and specifications.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">5. A
10+ port Ethernet switch hub is an optional addition but will be
needed in wired systems. Most ADSL routers already provide a few
extra Ethernet ports (4 to 5 ports) that you can use to start a small
wired network.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">6. 100
meters more or less of Cat5 cable and some tools including connector
crimper, wire cutters, cable tester, drill, ladder. All this is
optional if you want to hire a contractor to do your new cable runs
or you just want to remain small with just a single wifi access
point. You could later become a contractor for other FreeNet
installations if you want. Just give FreeNet a call and we will add
you to our list of possible contractors after you complete FreeNet
installation certification. You should have at least a cable tester
to verify and isolate troubled wire installations they are only 300
baht and will save you time and make sure that your contractors did
there job before they leave. All FreeNet certified installers will
have one .</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>List of FreeNet
software features</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">1. User
online self registration. A user can connect and start using FreeNet
without any contact with a human even without a credit card. The
local FreeNet admin (you) will be notified when a new user starts and
you can contact them and collect your money when you have the time to
do so. If the customer uses a credit card the admin does nothing,
it's all automatic. Your paypal account will receive there payments.
You can use your PayPal ATM card to get your money when you want to
spend it or transfer the funds to your local bank account at some
point. The Credit or paypal payment system is optional if you want to
run a cash only system it's up to you.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">2. User
tracking and accounting. FreeNet keeps track of customer payments
with auto user expiration. When the users prepaid account runs out of
money the user is disabled access to the Internet and provided with
renew options.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">3.
FreeNet store to buy different packages of FreeNet Internet access
time with multiple methods of payment from credit card to cash all up
to the customer how he wants to pay or how the local admin wants to
receive his money. From 1 day to 1 year time windows are available to
the customer to provide only what the customer needs or wants. You
can add your own custom products or services as you wish but you must
have the minimal FreeNet packages available to be called a FreeNet
site.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">4.
FreeNet also has a local site forum that can be accessed by users
without membership to provide customers or possible future customers
a way to feedback system problems and for the FreeNet admin to
communicate changes in the networks status. The forum can also be
modified to add custom local interest feedback like crime activity
local social fun events (parties) or anything of interest in the
local surroundings. New subject addition can be opened to let the
users/customers decide what forums they want to add or support.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">5.
FreeNet local network online classified add system to advertise goods
for sale or a local apartments for rent in the building.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">6.
FreeNet local network auction site. Users can sell there goods or
services on the a local auction like ebay.com.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">7. File
sharing over the local network from the FreeNet server using Samba
can be implemented that enables Video on demand movies, music mp3
files or any application or document can be shared over the local LAN
at transfer speeds of up to 100 megabyte per second or more. Users
can read or write to the shared system if the admin (you) desires.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">8. VPN
virtual protected network service from anywhere in the world you can
access your local FreeNet server network with the same security you
have as if you were connected by wire. Useful when you are using wifi
locally or at a untrusted remote wifi site to do security critical
activities or just don't want people to know what your looking at or
to bypass some site restrictions. Presently we use Openvpn with
1024bit RSA encryption key pears. Equivalent to SSL encryption you
use to communicate with your bank with your browser.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">9. FXE
boot off LAN for wire customers only. Enables users to try out
several operating systems on there user console without ever needing
to install it on there local hard disk. Included boot off LAN
operating systems Ubuntu 8.04, Ubuntu 9.1, DSL (dam small Linux) and
more. Inside the Ubuntu 8.04 and 9.1 we also have Virtualbox that
enables the user to run windows XP, Vista, window 7 and other systems
within the security of the FXE booted Ubuntu systems. This includes
file persistence so when you or the user log out or turn off there
computers, files and changes will remain on the next system that
boots into this private FXE system account. This can be useful to
isolate user virus problems or to verify that a user has a hardware
problem on there user console computer or just a configuration
problem. You will later find that the more users that use Ubuntu
Linux the less problems they and you will have. Most of the problems
we receive are due to users with virus laden or mis configured
Windows systems. FXE provides a try before you install to promote
users to move to a better operating system.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

scheduled single point bittorent download services to prevent
disrupting shared bandwidth resources. Bittorrents downloads are
scheduled when and at a rate that keeps the other customers from ever
noticing any degradation in performance to the network.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">These
are just some of the more popular features. The list is endless and
FreeNet is adding new features every day. As the base of users grows
and feeds back what they want to change FreeNet will be there to give
customers whatever they might desire. FreeNet is a glimpse of what
many will see in the future but you will be a part of that future
today. We are only limited by our combined imaginations.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">2. Burn
a CD of the downloaded Ubuntu 8.04 ISO file onto a CD that will be

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">9. wait
for a call from FreeNet to inform you that the install has gone OK.
If something went wrong FreeNet will inform you over the phone of
what will need to be changed in the network hardware or software
settings before it becomes operational. If the local admin can't
solve the problem, FreeNet will schedule a n engineer to visit the
site to find the problem and issue needed instructions to the local
staff or contact contractors if needed. This should be done within 24
hours but if we have a flood of new installs it may take longer. Just
leave the computer turned on and connected to the Internet it's
should all automagicly install.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">10.
After the FreeNet contact in step 10, Try to connect to your new
FreeNet wifi site with another computer to verify you see a login
screen when you try to access the Internet with your test user
computer.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">11.
Setup a test user account on the FreeNet self registration form and
verify after registration and network login that your new user has
access to the Internet. If you have problems here FreeNet may be able
to help you with remote Desktop to show you what needs to be done. It
shouldn't be difficult but if you have a question just ask FreeNet.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">12.
That's it now you just wait for new users to connect and start
calling you asking you to accept there money to become members of
your new wifi and/or wire network. You may want to start advertising
with signs in the lobby of your building but it is not mandatory.
When people see the accespoint on wifi with the name “FreeNet”
they will know that's were they want to go for the best Internet
connection they will ever find at a price they can afford.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">13. Oh
I did forget to tell you that FreeNet is an expandable system it can
grow as you need it and you will be informed by FreeNet when we
detect you need more. You can also grow yourself at any rate you wish
but you will be required to meet FreeNet minimal performance
requirements. We make sure that your customers will receive what they
expect from FreeNet. Expansion can be as little as calling your ISP
provider to increase bandwidth or adding a backup redundant ADSL
line. A single server can provide up to 200 users or more but may
require some added hard disk space at some point in time and backup
redundant servers and more ISP provider lines can also be added in
larger installations.</P>
