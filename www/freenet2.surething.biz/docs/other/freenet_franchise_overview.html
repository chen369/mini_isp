Franchise License</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Become
an Internet service provider in Thailand (Pattaya, Bangkok...) with
the well known and trusted FreeNet brand name.  You can start your
own Internet+ service in any building with 10 units or more with the
help of our FreeNet software,  training and consulting services to
get you started.  The FreeNet software license is provided free when
used with  4 or less steady customers per month  in a single building
so you can start with what you already have for </SPAN><B>FREE</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
and build up your customers over time before you ever need to pay us
any monthly fee's or Royalties if you loss customers for a time you
don't have costs to us if you don't have income to pay them.  With  5
customers or more  FreeNet expects to receive 10%  of the gross
income of the installations and WIFI connections that are
automatically tracked with the FreeNet software.   When you become a
true member of FreeNet (paid franchise members only) you will receive
all the benefits FreeNet has to offer including auto fault detection
and call in support for you and your customers to get quick
installation  and customer trouble service support with true English
speaking personnel (English only at this time).   Remote diagnostics
and training are also available.  You will have access to all the
needed contractors and consultants to add or repair any part of your
systems as needed from our list of FreeNet certified contractors.  
You are not likely to find a cheaper franchise to start.  All you
need to start a minimal system is one small low powered computer for
a server such as a 1 ghz CPU with 512meg memory and 20 gig hard drive
(about 3000 baht used), a single internet service provider such as
TOT (500 baht per month) and a single wifi access point  (about 2000
baht).  You might already have some or all of these things.  Then all
you need is a one to three day lesson on how to setup and maintain
the system.  If you know anything about computers and or hardware it
may go faster or slower depending on your skill levels.  A days
lesson is 2000 baht for the FreeNet teacher to teach you what you
will need to know to setup and maintain the system and show you how
to setup the software on your server.  So just think you might be
able to start your first franchise for only 2000 Baht!!  Later if you
want to help teach others you can become  a certified FreeNet
instructor so  you can teach others  to become FreeNet franchise
holders and make even more money.  More advanced teaching can be done
 with remote teaching over the Internet where the instructor can
control and see the students screen using remote desktop where the
teacher can show you how to diagnose problems, do system
administration, accounting, network monitoring and more.  You don't
even need to invest to be a part of the FreeNet franchise.  You can
become a FreeNet sales representative.   All you need to do is find
people that want to become FreeNet Franchise holders.  If you get a
new FreeNet franchise to sign you will receiver from 1 to 10% of the
</SPAN>gross<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> of each Franchisee
that signs up through you for the first  year of each franchise plus
10% of the lessons and consulting fee's that each of the Franchisee
pays to FreeNet.</SPAN></FONT></P>

  ⧫ <FONT SIZE=4><B>Quick installation.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4> 
With FreeNet our customers expect to have service within 24 hours
from the time they order it.   FreeNet accomplishes this with local
on premises support and installation personnel. We train the
franchise holder to support and install new customers within that 24
hour window of time and provides backup contractors to do the things
that the franchise holder can't or doesn't want to do.  We also
enable the customer to do there own online registration so that they
can get started without any help at all from the site owner.  With
the skills we teach you and our contractors, you can also become a
backup contractor to other franchise holders that need your help.  
All the FreeNet franchise members  work together to make the best
Internet service available today.  Where residents only stay for
short stays of 1 to 6 months they don't want to wait 2 to 3 months to
get service.    They prefer a quick reliable connection and that is
FreeNet.</FONT></P>

categorize Internet traffic to keep high bandwidth user traffic from
slowing down the browser traffic by using the dual redundant
providers to service each group separately.</FONT></P>
