<FONT SIZE=4>If you don't have the money needed to start your FreeNet
franchise you still have some hope left.  FreeNet can offer the money
needed to some groups on credit/share holder terms to start your
franchise if FreeNet sees a good possibility of payback in the
location you plan to install your system.  In some cases we will
finance 100% of the total startup cost but normally would like some
token from the franchise client to show true interest in the plan or
provide some existing assets needed for the network.  First give us a
call and tell us the location and the size of the building you plan
to install a FreeNet network.  If the size and location meet to our
standards we will come out and take a closer look at the location and
talk with the needed parties to setup a possible installation or test
site.  In the event we do agree to finance these are the terms we
required.</FONT></P>

 <FONT SIZE=4>In this example case FreeNet is a part lender and part
share holder in you franchise for example in a 100% finance we become
a 49% share holder in your franchise.  We are entitled 49% of the
profits made by your franchise site.  The profit is calculated after
payment of all fee's to the ISP providers possible maintenance and
misc expenses and  the 15% gross franchise license fee's that are
still payable to FreeNet (see license agreement statement to see
details of license fee's).  After a test period of normally 3 months
to 1 year FreeNet will give you the client the option to buy out our
shares of the franchise.   If you the client are not interested in
buying out the FreeNets shares at the offered price determined by
what we see the value is at that time, then FreeNet has the option to
offer to buy your 51% shares.  If both parties find the business to
be none profitable and NOT wish to continue at the offered prices
then FreeNet can exercise it's right to foreclose on all purchased
and licensed assets held by the franchise including servers (if
purchased with FreeNet capital), software, network switches, access
points, network equipment, wiring and terminate the ISP services and
all other parts setup with FreeNet capital.  There is always the
possibility that  both parties decide to continue to hold the 49% and
51% shares over longer term but most franchise holders decide to buy
out some or all shares when the money becomes available.  FreeNet
normally offers to sell there shares at a reasonable price to pay
costs and expenses with about 20% profit, so we can  take the money
to finance another new site.  The more site we have the more we all
make.</FONT></P>
