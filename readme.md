It is designed to be used in short to medium term residence like Hotels or resort apartments where residences want a quick method to connect to the Internet from between 1 day to 3 months or longer.  Mini ISP provides captive portal redirected service to unregistered users and enables them to choose and purchase online the desired duration of time to be allowed access to the Internet.
