these test run on virtualbox with openwrt10.03
download http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/x86_generic/openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext2.vdi
add it to a new virtualbox as harddisk
details http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/virtualbox

defaults to ip 192.168.1.1

login with browser to set password, no password is default with root user

to setup serial com port console pipe from ubuntu
socat /tmp/openwrt -

I added another network port in browser to be dhcp active, I reversed this to be bridged to eth0 on ubuntu
will set openwrt ip dynamic for eth1 was last 192.168.2.136
ubuntu eth2 will be briged to br-lan  and will be static set to 192.168.3.250

eth0 -> br-lan 192.168.182.1 dhcpd active -> interalnet -> lubuntu used as test client
eth1 -> dhcp-client 192.168.2.136 -> bridged to freeNET on bigboy eth0

I have setup an internal virtualbox netowork to test between lubuntu as a test client
to connect to openwrt on intnet  with lubuntu set to dhcp auto
openwrt intnet set to 192.168.182.1  on eth1 that will have dhcpd set active on this port

after coovachilli installer 
rm /etc/init.d/dnsmasq ; this fixed not being able to ping surething.biz but now fails dhcpd


had to add to /etc/config/network:  this can be done in browser above
config 'interface' 'wan'
        option 'proto' 'dhcp'
        option 'ifname' 'eth1'


/etc/chili/config almost works
HS_WANIF=eth1            # WAN Interface toward the Internet 
HS_LANIF=eth0 # Subscriber Interface for client devices 
HS_NETWORK=192.168.182.0 # HotSpot Network (must include HS_UAMLISTEN) 
HS_NETMASK=255.255.255.0 # HotSpot Network Netmask

HS_UAMSERVER=192.168.2.250

HS_UAMFORMAT=http://\$HS_UAMSERVER/hotspotlogin.php                

HS_UAMHOMEPAGE=http://\$HS_UAMLISTEN:\$HS_UAMPORT/prelogin

not sure where to put this yet and it's optional in /etc/firewall.user
# Always allow these ports on WAN interface for router admin as well 
iptables -I zone_wan -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT;
iptables -I zone_wan -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT;
iptables -I zone_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT;
#iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE;

with this config I'm getting conflicting ip on eth0 and tun0 at 192.168.182.1

to auto start at power up
/etc/init.d/chilli enable
#optional to save memory
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable
/etc/init.d/uhttpd disable

note: I couldn't get the browser chromium to work with UAM but firefox worked find on Lubuntu 10.04
