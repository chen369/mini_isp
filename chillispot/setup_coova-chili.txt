install and configure daloradius  with coova-chilli  on ubuntu 10.04
assumes you have ubuntu with lamp appache installed  
for details see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CategoryNetworking/daloRADIUS

      daloRADIUS homepage is hosted on sourceforge at the address of http://sourceforge.net/projects/daloradius/ and you may get the latest release from there if you haven't already done so.

       wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/daloradius/files/daloradius/daloradius-0.9-8/daloradius-0.9-8.tar.gz/download

      extract the daloradius.tar.gz archive to /var/www

       tar -zxvf daloradius-0.9-8.tar.gz

       mv daloradius-0.9-8 daloradius

       sudo cp daloradius/ /var/www -R
sudo chmod 644 /var/www/daloradius/library/daloradius.conf.php

cd /var/www/daloradius/contrib/db/

mysql -u root -p
Enter password:mysqladminsecret

FreeRADIUS 2.X

    * If you are working with FreeRADIUS 2.X (Ubuntu 10.04) then:

       mysql -u root -p radius < fr2-mysql-daloradius-and-freeradius.sql

Database Connection Setup

Now, simply adjust the MySQL database information in daloRADIUS's config file.

cd /var/www/daloradius/library/

sudo nano -w daloradius.conf.php

FreeRADIUS 2.X

    * If you are working with FreeRADIUS 2.X (Ubuntu 10.04) then:

       $configValues['FREERADIUS_VERSION'] = '2';

       $configValues['CONFIG_DB_PASS'] = 'password';

       $configValues['CONFIG_DB_TBL_RADUSERGROUP'] = 'radusergroup';

sudo chmod +r /usr/local/etc/raddb/dictionary
radtest sacarlson scottc localhost 1812 testing123
now segmentation faults when I run radtest or radclient
this might be ipv6 problem?
will try radtest sacarlson scottc 127.0.0.1 1812 testing123

did apt-get purge all radius packages of version 2.1.8
added ppa radius version 2.1.12

start back with packages  still has 2.1.12 ppa setup in repository
renamed /etc/freeradius to /etc/freeradius.org
apt-get install freeradius freeradius-mysql
freeradius-ldap

I don't see any files in /etc/freeradius/modules they should have been installed with freeradius package
set repository freeradius 2.1.8 non ppa for ubuntu 10.04
installed
freeradius
freeradius-mysql
freeradius-ldap

edited /etc/freeradius/sql.conf  for sacarlson mysql account info

still: 
/etc/freeradius/modules/exec[24]: Invalid version in module 'rlm_exec'
rename /usr/local/etc/raddb to raddb.org

tried I decided to try build of 2.1.10 release on my ubuntu 10.04  with just ./configure; make; I get make[9]: *** No rule to make target `rlm_eap_pwd.h', needed by `rlm_eap_pwd.c'.  Stop.
(11:04:57 PM) sacarlson: so I guess that version also has problems?
(11:05:45 PM) sacarlson: also did make clean; before I ran at commitish 1d1e9b7372abecfc0942b127e5faf90df547e198

tried 2.1.11 34c68ba800632ccca564f6bdcb186e32886684c1
make clean
.configure
make
make[9]: *** No rule to make target `rlm_eap_pwd.h', needed by `rlm_eap_pwd.c'.  Stop.

tried 2.1.11 again this time erased all added files left behind from checkouts of newer versions
.configure
make
looks good so far
/usr/local/sbin$ sudo ./radiusd -X

I note that this file was here before, I'll try another version


**should start here to get it to work without most the problems above********************************************************************

try 2.1.X be9f5b6cf71e21f28ccbb8893085690f89b4f0d4  same method delete all added files in git

uncommented sql in line athenticate{... sql ... }; 

now when I restart radiusd -X

/usr/local/etc/raddb/dictionary  had to change permisions to allow other read access
to get http://localhost/daloradius/config-maint-test-user.php  to work

found one more thing that needs to change
/usr/local/etc/raddb/sites-enabled/default  uncomment sql tags in authorize {...}

now I get:
 sudo radtest sacarlson password localhost 1812 testing123
Sending Access-Request of id 10 to 127.0.0.1 port 1812

rad_recv: Access-Accept packet from host 127.0.0.1 port 1812, id=10, length=26
	Session-Timeout = 654780

and works in daloradius>config>maintenance>test user conectivity.

I also had to add user in daloradius to get this to work at management>new user>user name authentication>apply

adding date accounting
/usr/local/etc/raddb/sites-enabled/default  uncomment sql tags in accounting {...} post-auth {...}
 
new problem:
 Wed May 23 12:12:16 2012 : Error: Ignoring request to authentication address * port 1812 from unknown client 192.168.2.122 port 55308
when I try to authenticate from another system to bigboy server.
to correct this had to add:
client 192.168.0.0/16 {
	secret		= testing123
	shortname	= freenet
}

to /usr/local/etc/raddb/clients.conf
radius is now working

had to add to /etc/config/network:  this can be done in the browser also
config 'interface' 'wan'
        option 'proto' 'dhcp'
        option 'ifname' 'eth1'


file is missing at /etc/init.d/chilli  found a copy here https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=31529
ssh 
cd /etc/init.d
wget http://192.168.2.250/chilli.sh;  mv chilli.sh chilli; chmod +x chilli;

I note that we need to set the static ip on the lan side of openwrt to be 192.168.182.1  as that's is used 
in hotspotlogin.php  unless we later change the hardcoded ip in the file.
I found the hotspotlogin.php to replace the cgi perl script at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/ChillispotHotspot

had to add these lines to /etc/chilli/config  to get mac athentication to work
HS_MACAUTH=on	
HS_MACREAUTH=on
HS_MACPASSWD=macpass

mysql radcheck format for mac athentication:
08-00-27-8B-5F-E5 	Auth-Type 	:= 	Accept
