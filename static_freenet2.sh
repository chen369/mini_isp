# at 192.168.0.1 (windows side) that we use to temp connect to 
# a telephone modem network.  use wizard on windows to setup network
# share then run this command to add alias ip address.
# we should still be on the 192.168.1.101 address as eth0 so we 
# can switch back when the adsl starts working again.
# note.. I had to add 192.168.0.1 to /etc/resolv.conf

sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 freenet2
sudo route del default
sudo route add default gw router
